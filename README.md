# Tarsorado Demon

A fork of ItzKiba's **Grandpa Demon** mod, but with 21 extra demon difficulties instead of 5, covering almost the entire spectrum of the original demon difficulty image.

These are similarly based on [AREDL](https://aredl.pages.dev/#/):

* Top 1 - Final Boss
* Top 10 - Infinite Demon
* Top 25 - Ultra Demon
* Top 50 - Super Demon
* Top 100 - Mega Demon
* Top 150 - Golden Demon

The rest is equally distributed across the AREDL rankings, meaning each difficulty will have roughly the same amount of demons (~50 as of writing this).
